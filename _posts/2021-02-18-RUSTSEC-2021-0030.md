### Description

Affected versions of `scratchpad` used `ptr::read` to read elements while
calling a user provided function `f` on them.

Since the pointer read duplicates ownership, a panic inside the user provided
`f` function could cause a double free when unwinding.

The flaw was fixed in commit `891561bea` by removing the unsafe block and using
a plain iterator.
