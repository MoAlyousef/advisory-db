### Description

Affected versions of `bam` set the length of an internal buffer using
`self.compressed.set_len(block_size - HEADER_SIZE - MIN_EXTRA_SIZE)` and then
wrote into it. While `block_size` was constrained to a proper maximum, when it
was too small the subtraction could overflow negatively to a large number past
the capacity of `self.compressed`.

This can result in memory corruption in the form of writing out of bounds when
loading a `bgzip` file with a small `block_size`.

Commit `061eee38d4` fixed this issue by checking for the underflow when setting
the buffer size.
