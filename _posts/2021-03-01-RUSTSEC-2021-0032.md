### Description

The `read_bytes_default_le` function for `[T; n]` arrays, used to deserialize
arrays of `T` from bytes created a `[T; n]` array with `std::mem::uninitialized`
and then called `T`'s deserialization method.

If `T`'s deserialization method panicked, the uninitialized memory could drop
invalid objects.

This flaw was corrected in `a535678` by removing the unsafe block and using
a `.map` function to deserialize each element of the array instead.
